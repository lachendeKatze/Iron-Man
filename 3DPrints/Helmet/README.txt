#CostumeChallenge

# Instructions

The Main part need to be cut in multiple parts, you can use netfabb basic which is free and very usefull  
The other parts are ready to print  
The mask have support that i made myself so it is easier to remove them  
I used a standard size servo from hobby king which cost 3.50$  
and I opened it, plugged the dc wired direct from the dual direction switch to the servo motor, dont need the control board anymore.  
A 4 AA battery pack wich give 6 volts and cost 0.99$ at  local electronic store.  
A two direction dc switch about 2.99$  
A stop switch to cut the current when at top position  
The back part open by a pivot and is holding in closed position with strong magnets from ebay.
